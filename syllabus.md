## About BMI 702

Artificial intelligence is poised to enable breakthroughs in science and reshape medicine. This introductory course provides a survey of artificial intelligence for biomedical informatics, covering methods for key data modalities: clinical data, networks, language, and images. It introduces machine learning problems from a practical perspective, focusing on tasks that drive the adoption of machine learning in biology and medicine. It outlines foundational algorithms and emphasizes the subtleties of working with biomedical data and ways to evaluate and transition machine learning methods into biomedical and clinical implementation. An important consideration in this course is the broader impact of artificial intelligence, particularly topics of bias and fairness, interpretability, and ethical and legal considerations when dealing with artificial intelligence.

### Goals

- Prepare students for advanced courses in data science, machine learning, and statistics, by providing the necessary foundation and context
- Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to address real-world problems
- Understand artificial intelligence methods from a practical perspective
- Understand best practices in implementing, evaluating, and validating ML methods on biomedical data
- Apply ML methods to key data modalities: clinical data, biomedical networks, text, and images
- Understand the pros and cons of different ML methods to select the right method for a given scenario
- Recognize the problem of bias in biomedical data and ML methods in healthcare
- Understand the concept of fairness in biomedical ML
- Become familiar with ethical considerations for biomedical data and algorithms

### Syllabus

The overall structure is as follows. The course comprises 14 lectures. We provide a course overview and introduction to biomedical AI in the first lecture. The remaining 13 lectures are divided into six modules. The first lecture in each module is foundational and introduces key machine learning concepts in the area, and the following lectures cover advanced topics and frontiers of the same area.

## Course Culture

Students taking BMI 702 come from a wide range of backgrounds. We hope to foster an inclusive and safe learning environment based on curiosity rather than competition. All members of the course community—the instructor, TAs and students—are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect. Some of the responsibility for that lies with the staff, but a lot of it ultimately rests with you, the students.

### Be Aware of Your Actions

Sometimes, the little things add up to creating an unwelcoming culture to some students. Bear in mind that diversity has many facets, some of which are not visible. Your classmates may have medical conditions (physical or mental), personal situations (financial, family, etc.), or interests that aren’t common to most students in the course. Another aspect of professionalism is avoiding comments that (likely unintentionally) put down colleagues for situations they cannot control. Bragging in open space that an assignment is easy or “crazy,” for example, can send subtle cues that discourage classmates who are dealing with issues that you can’t see. Please take care, so we can create a class in which all students feel supported and respected.

Beyond the slips that many of us make unintentionally are a host of behaviors that the course staff, department, and university do not tolerate. These are generally classified under the term harassment; sexual harassment is a specific form that is governed by federal laws known as Title IX.

### Be Respectful

Professionalism and respect for diversity are not just matters between students; they also apply to how the course staff treat the students. The staff of this course will treat you in a way that respects our differences. However, despite our best efforts, we might slip up, hopefully inadvertently. If you are concerned about classroom environment issues created by the staff or overall class dynamic, please feel free to talk to us about it. The instructor particular welcomes any comments or concerns regarding conduct of the course and the staff.

We are committed to creating a learning environment welcoming of all students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences and respects your identities and backgrounds. If you feel like your performance in the class is being affected by your experiences outside of class (e.g., family matters, current events), please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be resources for you.

## Attendance

Students must attend all classes unless they have explicit permission from the course instructor. An unexcused absence can affect the participation grade. This Spring, BMI 702 will be run in a in-person format.

- To see when any live events are scheduled, check the [Weekly Schedule](../schedule).
- To see when lectures, discussions, and assignments are released (and due), check the [Home Page](../).

### Auditing

Auditing BMI 702 is only permitted with explicit permission by the course faculty. Auditors must not increase the workload for instructors and TAs, or compete with enrolled students for other resources provided for students who are paying tuition, such as space in online classrooms or time during office hours.

If you are planning to audit the course but want to get more involved, i.e. submit homework assignments, use office hours, etc., you are encouraged to register as a “special student”, which provides access to this course at a per credit cost.

### Quick Checks

Quick Checks are short conceptual questions embedded into each lecture, in the form of Google Forms. **Quick Checks count towards class participation grade.** They are meant for you to check your understanding of the concepts that were just introduced. That is, your score on them does not matter, you just need to do them. 

### Problem Sets

Problem sets are two-week-long assignments that are designed to help students develop an in-depth understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of ideas presented in lecture. The primary form of support students will have for problem sets are the **office hours** we’ll host, and **Canvas Discussions**. Problems sets must be completed individually.

### Office Hours

- The office hours are listed on the [Weekly Schedule](../schedule), and will be held both virtually and in-person.
- Students can come to office hours for any questions on course assignments or material.
- In-person office hours will be held in various locations specified in the [Weekly Schedule](../schedule). 
- The instructor will also be hosting office hours. These will be reflected on the [Weekly Schedule](../schedule).

### Regrade Requests

Students will be allowed to submit regrade requests for the autograded and written portions of assignments in cases in which the rubric was incorrectly applied or the autograder scored their submission incorrectly. 

Regrade requests will **not** be considered in cases in which:

- a student submits incorrect files and the student does not notify the course staff _before the assignment deadline_
- a student fails to save their notebook before exporting and uploads an old version to the online system
- a situation arises in which the course staff cannot ensure that the student's work was done before the assignment deadline

## Policies

### Late Policy

All assignments are due at 11:59 pm on the due date specified on the syllabus. 

Extensions are only provided in the case of exceptional circumstances. For that, email the course instructor to request an extension. If you make a request close to the deadline, we can not guarantee that you will receive a response before the deadline. Additionally, simply submitting a request does not guarantee you will receive an extension. Even if your work is incomplete, please submit before the deadline so you can receive credit for the work you did complete.

### Collaboration Policy and Academic Dishonesty

We will be following the [Harvard Medical School policy on Academic Honesty](https://medstudenthandbook.hms.harvard.edu/4-student-conduct-and-responsibility), which states that using work or resources that are not your own or not permitted by the course may lead to disciplinary actions, up to and including a failing grade in the course. It is the student’s responsibility to be aware of these policies and ensure that their work adheres to them in detail and in spirit. Unless otherwise specified by the instructor, the assumption is that all work submitted must reflect the student’s own effort and understanding. Students are expected to clearly distinguish their own ideas and knowledge from information derived from other sources, including from collaboration with other people. Specifically, this means that:

- Students must properly cite all submitted work appropriately.
- Unless noted otherwise, students are expected to complete assignments, quizzes, and projects individually, not as teams. Discussion about course content and materials is acceptable, but sharing solutions is not acceptable.
- Even though students are encouraged to consult websites for solutions to coding problems, they may never just copy code.

If you have a question about how best to complete an assignment in light of these policies, ask the instructor for clarification.

### Assignments

Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually in your own words. If we suspect that you have submitted plagiarized work, we will call you in for a meeting. If we then determine that plagiarism has occurred, we reserve the right to give you a negative full score (-100%) or lower on the assignments in question, along with reporting your offense to the Center of Student Conduct.

Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The entire staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the assignments, you won't need to copy any answers. 

### We want you to succeed!

If you are feeling overwhelmed, visit our office hours and talk with us. We know graduate school can be stressful and we want to help you succeed.

## Academic and Other Support Services

We value your well-being and recognize that as a graduate or professional student, you are asked to balance various responsibilities and potential stressors. If you are struggling with experiences either in or outside of class, there are resources available to help. HMS students should contact their home program administrator or the Office of Graduate Education to access academic or personal support services.

All students have access to Counseling and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) available in Longwood, Cambridge, or remotely via webcam or phone. The use of CAMHS is included in the student health fee, regardless of insurance, at no additional cost. More information is available at [https://camhs.huhs.harvard.edu](https://camhs.huhs.harvard.edu) or by calling the main office at 617-495-2042. Urgent care can be reached 24/7 at 617-495-5711.

### Reasonable Accommodations

As an institution that values diversity and inclusion, our goal is to create learning environments that are usable, equitable, inclusive, and welcoming. Harvard University complies with federal legislation for individuals with disabilities and offers reasonable accommodations to qualified students with documented disabilities and temporary impairments. To make a request for reasonable accommodations in a course, students must first connect with their local disability office. The primary point of contact for HMS-based master’s and medical students is the HMS Director of Disability Services.
 
Accommodations are determined through an interactive process and are not retroactive. Therefore, students should contact their local disability office as soon as possible, preferably at least two weeks before accommodations are needed in a course. Students are strongly encouraged to discuss their access needs with their instructors; however, instructors cannot independently institute individual accommodations without prior approval from the disability office. Student privacy surrounding disability status is recognized under FERPA. Information about accommodations is shared on a need-to-know basis with only those involved in instituting the accommodation.
